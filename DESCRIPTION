Description: Implements Penalized Fast Causal Inference (PFCI), a two-stage
    causal structure learning procedure for high-dimensional settings.
    The method combines graphical lasso screening with constrained
    Fast Causal Inference (FCI) to reduce computational burden while
    preserving consistency under sparsity assumptions. The package
    provides estimation, toy simulation, and evaluation utilities
    for partially directed acyclic graphs (PAGs).
